Name of the project: 
Simple Vector Calculator


Brief Description: 
This app is a basic GUI calculator designed for vector calculations, such as the cross product or resultant vector, in a fast and reliable manner, rather than doing them by hand. 

This project has been written in Python (version 3.13.7). It uses these libraries: Tkinter and NumPy. 

There are three unique files for the calculator: 
The calculator operations, the image for the icon of the calculator, and the main GUI and setup of the calculator. 

Target audience:
The target users for this app are anyone who needs a calculator for basic vector operations, such as educators, engineers, or mathematicians.
This app is designed for students, educators, engineers, or anyone else who needs to perform quick and reliable vector calculations without manual calculation.
Set-Up Instructions: 

Instructions for use:
Download the folder containing the files calculator_funcs.py, Icon_mogged.png, and Vector_Calc.py. Make sure you pip install NumPy and Tkinter as the project relies on these being in place. Once that is completed, you can run the code using the Vector_Calc.py file on VSCode, Notepad++, etc (basically any IDE). If there is a way to make .py files into .exe, then you may also do that, if preferred.
